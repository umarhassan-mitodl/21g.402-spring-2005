Language Lab
------------

Regular daily attendance at the Language Learning and Resource Center (LLARC) for short periods of time (15-20 minutes) is strongly suggested. Please record the time you spend working with the different parts of the tape system both in the lab and at home on the lab log provided ({{% resource_link 8a63d724-4e95-85d7-886d-c13bb2fb6e42 "PDF" %}}). The lab log will be collected by the instructor with the Workbook/Lab Manual.

Homework
--------

Maximum of 8 hours per week. This includes **daily** practice with the tapes in the LLARC and at home. It is crucial that you work regularly at a station in the LLARC, where you can practice hearing your own recorded voice in comparison with the voice on the tape.
